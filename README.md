# Stata Utilities

A collection of small Stata programs that I have written and keep re-using.

## Programs

- **assertapprox.do** - Assert that two values are approximately equal within a specified tolerance
- **geodist.do** - Calculate geodetic distances between geographic coordinates
- **merge_rmstr.do** - Merge two data sets with a string removed from the match variable (e.g., "ABC Inc." matches to "ABC" if "Inc" is the removed string)

I have not created documentation for these programs, but feel free to contact me with questions.
